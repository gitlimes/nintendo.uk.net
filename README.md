# nintenclo.com, a.k.a. NotTendo

A website that lets you create official-looking Nintendo links that rickroll the visitor. Supports nintendo.com and any of its subdomains. For more info (and statistics), visit [nintenclo.com/usage](https://nintenclo.com/usage).

Make sure to check out my sibling project, [microsoftgithub.com](https://microsoftgithub.com/usage)

## Usage

Simply replace `nintendo.com` with `nintenclo.com`. The resulting URL will redirect to the rickroll video, but its social media preview will look identical to the official page on nintendo.com
